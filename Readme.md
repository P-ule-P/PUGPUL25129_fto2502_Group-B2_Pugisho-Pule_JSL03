# Career Development Plan 🎓

## Project Description 🧾

The Career Development Plan Kanban Board is a simple project management tool designed to help aspiring developers organize and track their progress toward launching a new career. Inspired by agile principles, it uses a classic Kanban layout with three stages—🔵TODO, 🟣DOING, and 🟢DONE—to visually manage tasks and milestones. The board promotes focus, persistence, and structured growth, offering users a clear overview of their journey. Although centred on tech careers, the concept can be easily adapted for various goals and projects.
